CtrlMouseWheelHandler.cs
------------------------

In response to a [question from SonoranCellist on twitter](http://twitter.com/SonoranCellist/status/5643305534).

This is a simple extension for turning ctrl+mouse wheel events into scrolling by page instead of scrolling by line (or zooming, since that is the key combination for the zoom control).
